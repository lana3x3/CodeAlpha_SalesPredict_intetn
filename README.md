Forecasting Sales with Python

 This project uses machine learning techniques to predict future sales.  Predictive models are constructed using features like sales platforms, target client segments, and advertising expenditure.  The procedure involves feature selection, data processing, and cleaning to guarantee high-quality modeling input.  Time series and regression techniques are used to create precise sales projections.  Data-driven insights are provided by the study, which also examines how differences in advertising expenditures affect sales results.  The project assists companies in enhancing revenue planning and marketing strategies through the use of Python tools such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
